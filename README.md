One note about updated files with suffix such as "_windows", "_speaker":
remember to remove the suffix to be able to compile (build).

For example, after downloading the controller file "tiago_titanium_speaker.c",
remove "_speaker" to make it "tiago_titanium.c".

In this case, the make file can recognize it and 
successfully build any changes in the file.

Good luck!
