# 16467-FinalProject
Rock Paper Scissor playing Webot

One note about updated files with suffix such as "_windows", "_speaker":
remember to remove the suffix to be able to compile (build).

For example, after downloading the controller file "tiago_titanium_speaker.c",
remove "_speaker" to make it "tiago_titanium.c".

In this case, the make file can recognize it and 
successfully build any changes in the file.

## Update:
The most updated version is "tiago_titanium.c" and "tiago_titanium.wbt"

## Operator Rules:

Before each round:
- Set robot to the default position using “D”
- Have it say “Rock, Paper, Scissor, Shoot!” using space bar

Move:
- Press “R” for rock, “P” for paper or “S” for scissor
- Press “D” to bring it back to default

Result: 
- If won: press “W”
- If lost: press “L”
- If tie: press “T”

*Note: when you run trials have someone on the team with you to watch the interaction and give the operator pointers on which move to do next*

Good luck!
